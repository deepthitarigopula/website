        <p>No more does age, gender, occasions, and skin tones restrict the definition of terms like beauty and grooming.</p>
        <p>In fact, in today's world, the right grooming is considered as one of the important aspects that lead to confidence and ‘feel good factor. Beauty services have had a paradigm shift in their definitions. They are now viewed as self investments which leads to confidence and happiness. Also, irrespective of gender, today’s individual focuses on looking their best on a regular day at the office, unlike in the old times as the social constructs and conventional ways associated with appearance are fading away. Beauty and grooming are now a self-pampering experience to relish rather than an imposed condition of society to look good.</p>
